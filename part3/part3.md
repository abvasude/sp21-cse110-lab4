1. The bug was that the code was simply concatenating strings instead of actually adding two numbers together.
2. We would fix this by converting the variables types of both numbers from string to number. Check Fixed Sum code Screenshot for specific details. I used the Number function for both num1 and num2 when adding them together. In this way, result had the added values of num1 and num2 without concatenation.
